<h2>About Us</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hey there! We are a game studio based in Orlando, Florida, specializing in the development of simple software using HTML, CSS, and JS. Our journey began with a small group of friends working on a school project, which eventually led us to grow into the successful Buckaroo Studios that we are today. Our first game, <a href="https://buckaroostudios.github.io/ExoSim"><b>ExoSim</b></a>, was a result of our passion for gaming and the desire to create an immersive experience for our players. We take pride in our commitment to delivering high-quality games that cater to the entertainment needs of our audience.</p>
